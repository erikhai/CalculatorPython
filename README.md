# CalculatorPython

## What is this project about
This project was mainly used for me to test my understanding of GUI creations in python. I copied the Microsoft calculator and used that as my base template regarding how my calculator will run and operate.

## What did I learn from this project
1. Debugging with global variables (I will limit my usage of them from now on)
2. Understanding more about button and entry box placing in python
3. Messageboxes and how to use them
4. Code Documentation
## What are the future plans of this project
1. Add more features such as pi or using fractions etc
2. Re work this so it depends less on global variables (once you start going global, the whole thing becomes a mess. Unfortunately I learnt this the hard way)
3. Light and Dark mode
