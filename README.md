# CalculatorPython
## Version 1
In this version, my calculator can do the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). The user can input the digits from 0 - 9 via the buttons on the app or from the keyboard. The user can also perform the basic operations by using the buttons from the application or from the keyboard. The user can also create decimal numbers and negative numbers. Appropriate error checking has been established (division by 0). I have also created light and dark modes for the calculator as well as a help menu for users to see how to use this application
## What are the plans for the next version?
1. Improvements: I am not satisfied with the way the buttons are displayed on the application. While it works for the basic calculator, if I were to extend the calculator to be scientific, the placements of the buttons will be hard to make consistent. 
2. Introducing a new mode (scientific). This will allows users to be able to perform more calculations such as using pi, sin, cos, tan, being able to add brackets in their operations etc.
